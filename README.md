## About the Project
The Palindrome Checker is a simple web application that allows users to check if a given text is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

### Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use
Enter text in the input field and click the "Check" button to see if it is a palindrome. The result will be displayed below the input field.

## HTML Structure
The HTML structure consists of a heading, two cards containing text and input fields, and a result section.

## JavaScript Function
The `isPalindrome` function checks whether a given string is a palindrome by removing non-alphanumeric characters, converting to lowercase, and comparing with its reversed version.

## CSS Styling
The CSS file contains styles for the layout, cards, input fields, buttons, and result display.
